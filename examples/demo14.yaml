    # COSMOS galaxies are generated from a cosmos_catalog (see below).
    # They are based on the COSMOS field observed with HST.  The size and flux distribution
    # are appropriate for an I < 23.5 magnitude limited survey.
    type : GenerativeModelGalaxy

    # The COSMOS galaxies can be either "real", meaning they are based on the real COSMOS
    # image, including features like spiral arms, star-bursting regions, etc, or "parametric"
    # which means either a Sersic fit or a bulge plus disk fit (according to which one gave
    # the better chisq).  Here we use real 30% of the time, and parametric 70%.

    # You can also specify the size of the image if you want, but if you omit it
    # (as we do here), then GalSim will automatically size the image appropriately.


# Typically, you will want to specify the output format and file name.
# If this is omitted, the output will be to a fits file with the same root name as the
# config file (so demo1.fits in this case), but that's usually not a great choice.
# So at the very least, you would typically want to specify at least the file_name.
